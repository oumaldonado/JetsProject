# JetsProject

# Description
The program I wrote reads information from a txt.file and that file consists of many jets.
The jets have predetermined information such as Type, model, etc.
The operation of this program is very simple. A menu will populate and show the options the user has.
I manipulated the data on the file to isolate specific types of planes and abilities.
The user can select any option they desire. The user can command the cargo planes to load cargo, and for the fighter jets to dog fight.
The program also allows user input. The user can create any Type of plane they would like, 
Keeping in mind they input the correct data.
My program also allows for the removal of any original or newly added  plane to be removed from the "air field".
Finally the program has the ability to close properly with the exit key.

# Lessons Learned 
This Project really challenged me in every possible way imaginable. I feel like I made a huge leap as far as my coding abilities. My understanding of the 4 Pillars of (OOP) has given me a much needed confidence boost. Inheritance was a huge hurdle for me to grasp and I feel like this opened my eyes to the major role it plays in OOP. From abstract classes to interfaces, the light bulb in my head is starting to flicker on . Another topic that I gained ground on was reading UML Diagrams. This helped me understand how images turn into code.
